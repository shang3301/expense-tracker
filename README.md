# Expense Tracker Application

A desktop-based expense tracking application built using Python, SQL, and Tkinter that allows users to manage financial data and visualize spending patterns.

---

## Overview
This project is a complete expense management system where users can create accounts, store transaction data in a relational database, and generate graphical analyses of their expenses.  
The application focuses on clarity, data organization, and transforming raw data into meaningful insight.

---

## Motivation
I built this project to understand how data-driven applications are structured end-to-end — from user input and database design to querying and visualization.  
I was particularly interested in how abstract concepts like relational tables and queries translate into tools that help users reflect on real-world behavior.

---

## Features
- User account creation and management  
- Relational database structure using SQL  
- Add, edit, and store expense records  
- Graphical analysis of spending patterns  
- Desktop GUI built with Tkinter  

---

## Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Database:** SQL (relational database)  
- **GUI:** Tkinter  
- **Visualization:** Python-based graphing tools  

---

## System Design
- Data is stored in structured SQL tables linked through user-specific relationships  
- Queries aggregate and filter expenses for analysis  
- The GUI serves as an abstraction layer between the user and the database  

This design emphasizes separation between data storage, logic, and presentation.

---

## Challenges & Learning
One of the main challenges was debugging interactions between the GUI and the database, where small logical errors could propagate across the system.  
Through iterative testing and restructuring, I learned how thoughtful data modeling simplifies both querying and user interaction.

---

## Reflection
This project reinforced the importance of persistence when building interconnected systems.  
It helped me see how careful design choices in data structures directly affect scalability, clarity, and user trust.

## Notes
This project was built as an independent learning exercise and is demonstrated in my video portfolio, where I explain the design decisions and development process.
